# Spotify_UI_Clone
This project is a clone of the Spotify user interface built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Spotify's web app, showcasing my skills in front-end design and responsiveness without using JavaScript. The layout includes key elements like navigation bars, playlists, and control buttons to mirror Spotify's design closely.
